# Testing



## W3C Validation

To validate every page of the project, that there were no syntax errors, these two Validators were used, W3C Validator and W3C CSS Validator.
To make make it easier to validate html code, since using jinja templating language throughout all pages, which results in errors in online validators. I used URL address.
For W3C Css Validator I copied css code directly.

* [W3C Validator](project_files/validators/w3c.jpg "W3C Validator")
* [W3C CSS Validator](project_files/validators/W3c_css.pdf "W3C CSS Validator")

## Jshint Validation

For this project I used jQuery - JavaScript Library for MaterializeCSS initialization: "Write less, do more."
Jshint were used to validate jQuery file of this project. [Click](project_files/validators/jshint.jpg) to view report.

## PEP8 Validation

Python code checked for PEP8 requirements. [Click](project_files/validators/pep8.jpg) to view report.

4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Creating a Clone

1. Install the [GitPod Browser](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension) Extension for Chrome.
2. After installation, restart the browser.
3. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [create an account](https://github.com/).
4. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sandra-Be/).
5. Click the green "GitPod" button in the top right corner of the repository. This will trigger a new gitPod workspace to be created from the code in github where you can work locally.

### How to run this project within a local IDE, such as VSCode

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [create an account](https://github.com/).
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Sandra-Be/).
3. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
4. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
